# Chapter 2: Literature Review and Theoretical Foundations

This chapter reviews the cross-disciplinary foundations of CET, revealing how existing research points toward a unified framework. While cognitive offloading, extended mind, scaffolding theory, and other fields each provide important insights, they lack **operationalizable evaluation criteria** and **unified design principles**—which are the core contributions of CET.

## 2.1 Cognitive Offloading Research: From Phenomena to Mechanisms

**Core concept**: Cognitive offloading refers to individuals delegating cognitive tasks to external systems to reduce internal cognitive load (Risko & Gilbert, 2016).

**Key findings**:

**Google effect** (Sparrow et al., 2011): When information is easily accessible, memory for the information itself declines, while memory for its storage location strengthens.
**GPS and spatial cognition** (Dahmani & Bohbot, 2020): Habitual GPS use is associated with spatial memory deficits and reduced hippocampal gray matter volume (directional evidence). This contrasts with Maguire et al. (2000): long-term spatial memory training in London taxi drivers was associated with enlargement of the posterior hippocampus. Together, these two lines of evidence function as a quasi-experimental contrast: the same cognitive function, different relationships to technology (independent training vs. dependency), and opposite neuroplastic tendencies.
**New evidence in the AI era** (Liao et al., 2024): AI assistance lacking cognitive friction leads to surface learning and an "illusion of learning"—learners believe they have mastered knowledge when they have merely relied on tools.

**Theoretical gaps**:

1. **Lack of evaluation criteria**: Descriptive findings do not yield normative criteria. When does "reasonable utilization" turn into "harmful dependency"?
2. **Lack of design guidance**: "Moderate use" is impractical as guidance—complete avoidance is impossible in a digital world.
3. **Lack of cross-scale integration**: Evidence concentrates on individuals, with limited connection to organizational/societal impacts.

**CET's contribution**: AVP ($P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$) provides an operationalizable, falsifiable evaluation criterion. EML provides a complete path from problem diagnosis to solution design.

## 2.2 Extended Mind Theory: From Philosophical Metaphor to Operationalizable Standards

**Core claim** (Clark & Chalmers, 1998): Cognitive boundaries need not be limited to the skull or skin. When external tools couple with cognitive processes in appropriate ways, they may count as parts of the cognitive system ("parity principle").

**Key limitations**:

1. **Lack of health criteria**: The theory clarifies what counts as cognition but not what kind of extension is healthy. Otto's notebook (compensatory tool) vs. excessive AI dependency (capability degradation) both qualify as "extended cognition," yet their health implications diverge.
2. **Ignoring process temporality**: It emphasizes states over processes, overlooking capability development dynamics. AI-assisted writing may be initially beneficial, yet continued dependence can stall independent capability.

**CET's reconstruction**: From "functional parity" to "process parity"—not only "does the tool help complete tasks" but also "does tool use promote capability enhancement." AVP supplies a falsifiable boundary: $P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$ (benign) vs. $P_2 < B_0$ (pathological). EML's systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0) helps ensure extension is temporary scaffolding rather than a permanent crutch.

## 2.3 Automation and Scaffolding: Failure Cases and Success Paths

**Automation paradox** (Bainbridge, 1983): The more perfect the automation, the worse operators' capabilities when intervention is needed. Aviation case (Air France Flight 447): Pilots operated normally under autopilot ($P_1$ high) but lacked manual proficiency when the system failed ($P_2$ low). This "permanent support → capability degradation" pattern is the "Cognitive Exoskeleton" CET warns against.

**Scaffolding theory** (Wood et al., 1976; Vygotsky, 1978): Effective instructional support is temporary, with systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0).

**Initial support**: Provide intensive support when capability is insufficient.
**Systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0)**: Reduce support as capability improves.
**Final independence**: Complete tasks without support.

**Comparative insight**: Automation paradox (permanent support → degradation) vs. scaffolding (systematic reduction → independence) jointly support EML Condition 2 (systematic support reduction).

## 2.4 Neuroplasticity and Cognitive Training

**Use-it-or-lose-it principle**: Frequently used neural pathways are strengthened; those idle for long periods are weakened. When AI fully replaces a cognitive function, the corresponding circuitry tends to degrade.

**Desirable Difficulties theory** (Bjork, 1994): Moderate difficulties promote long-term retention and transfer (working assumption with empirical support), including spaced practice, interleaving, and the generation effect.

**Optimal challenge zone**: Inspired by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), CET quantifies a 50–70% success rate (working assumption, population-level, with individual calibration). <30% risks frustration; >85% approaches offloading; 50–70% balances difficulty and growth.

**CET's transformation**: Converts evidence into three design knobs—① friction (50–70% success rate, working assumption), ② reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0), ③ validation ($P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$).

## 2.5 Theoretical Integration: Convergence of Cross-Disciplinary Evidence

**Triple convergence**:

1. **Negative-warning convergence**: Cognitive offloading (GPS), automation (pilot skills), neuroplasticity (use-dependent atrophy)—three independent lines all highlight "permanent dependency → capability atrophy," supporting CET's critique of the Cognitive Exoskeleton.
2. **Positive-path convergence**: Scaffolding (pedagogy), desirable difficulties (cognitive psychology), neuroplasticity (taxi drivers)—all point to "moderate challenge + systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0)," supporting EML's two conditions.
3. **Evaluation-gap convergence**: All lack a unified, operationalizable standard for judging healthy human-AI relationships—CET fills the gap via AVP/EML.

**CET's unique contribution**: Integrates scattered findings into a falsifiable framework amenable to engineering, addressing three gaps:

**Gap 1 (evaluation)**: AVP offers an operationalizable reference ($P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$).
**Gap 2 (design)**: EML prescribes beneficial friction + systematic reduction.
**Gap 3 (cross-scale)**: With LSA and cross-scale analysis, connects individual offloading, team patterns, and organizational resilience (see Chapter 4).
