0_raw\ARVIX2025AEN.md:1:# Human Capability Construction and Cognitive Resilience in the AI Era: A Theory of Cognitive Endosymbiosis Based on the Antifragility Validation Principle
0_raw\ARVIX2025AEN.md:13:Large language models and other AI tools are profoundly reshaping human work practices, yet their long-term impact on independent capabilities remains unclear. This study proposes the Cognitive Endosymbiosis Theory (CET), which measures whether independent capabilities are enhanced or degraded by AI assistance through the "Antifragility Validation Principle" (AVP). The research establishes a five-anchor measurement framework (B1-B5) and proposes design principles through the "Endosymbiotic Minimal Law" (EML), which promotes capability internalization via beneficial friction (50$\text{–}$70% success rate, working assumption) and systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0). The core criterion: $P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$ (post-unplugged capability must exceed baseline). The theory presents eight falsifiable hypotheses, explicitly defines applicability boundaries, and commits to open science validation (see Appendix B; Section 3.0 anchor texts).

0_raw\ARVIX2025BEN.md:32:**CET's reconstruction**: From "functional parity" to "process parity"—not only "does the tool help complete tasks" but also "does tool use promote capability enhancement." AVP supplies a falsifiable boundary: $P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$ (benign) vs. $P_2 < B_0$ (pathological). EML's systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0) helps ensure extension is temporary scaffolding rather than a permanent crutch.

copies\EN_full_part_A.md:1:# Human Capability Construction and Cognitive Resilience in the AI Era: A Theory of Cognitive Endosymbiosis Based on the Antifragility Validation Principle
copies\EN_full_part_A.md:13:Large language models and other AI tools are profoundly reshaping human work practices, yet their long-term impact on independent capabilities remains unclear. This study proposes the Cognitive Endosymbiosis Theory (CET), which measures whether independent capabilities are enhanced or degraded by AI assistance through the "Antifragility Validation Principle" (AVP). The research establishes a five-anchor measurement framework (B1-B5) and proposes design principles through the "Endosymbiotic Minimal Law" (EML), which promotes capability internalization via beneficial friction (50$\text{–}$70% success rate, working assumption) and systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0). The core criterion: $P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$ (post-unplugged capability must exceed baseline). The theory presents eight falsifiable hypotheses, explicitly defines applicability boundaries, and commits to open science validation (see Appendix B; Section 3.0 anchor texts).

copies\EN_full_part_B.md:32:**CET's reconstruction**: From "functional parity" to "process parity"—not only "does the tool help complete tasks" but also "does tool use promote capability enhancement." AVP supplies a falsifiable boundary: $P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$ (benign) vs. $P_2 < B_0$ (pathological). EML's systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0) helps ensure extension is temporary scaffolding rather than a permanent crutch.

0_raw\ARVIX2025AEN.md:13:Large language models and other AI tools are profoundly reshaping human work practices, yet their long-term impact on independent capabilities remains unclear. This study proposes the Cognitive Endosymbiosis Theory (CET), which measures whether independent capabilities are enhanced or degraded by AI assistance through the "Antifragility Validation Principle" (AVP). The research establishes a five-anchor measurement framework (B1-B5) and proposes design principles through the "Endosymbiotic Minimal Law" (EML), which promotes capability internalization via beneficial friction (50$\text{–}$70% success rate, working assumption) and systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0). The core criterion: $P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$ (post-unplugged capability must exceed baseline). The theory presents eight falsifiable hypotheses, explicitly defines applicability boundaries, and commits to open science validation (see Appendix B; Section 3.0 anchor texts).

copies\EN_full_part_A.md:13:Large language models and other AI tools are profoundly reshaping human work practices, yet their long-term impact on independent capabilities remains unclear. This study proposes the Cognitive Endosymbiosis Theory (CET), which measures whether independent capabilities are enhanced or degraded by AI assistance through the "Antifragility Validation Principle" (AVP). The research establishes a five-anchor measurement framework (B1-B5) and proposes design principles through the "Endosymbiotic Minimal Law" (EML), which promotes capability internalization via beneficial friction (50$\text{–}$70% success rate, working assumption) and systematic support reduction (S4$\rightarrow$S1$\rightarrow$S0). The core criterion: $P_2 \geq B_0 + \delta$ (post-unplugged capability must exceed baseline). The theory presents eight falsifiable hypotheses, explicitly defines applicability boundaries, and commits to open science validation (see Appendix B; Section 3.0 anchor texts).
